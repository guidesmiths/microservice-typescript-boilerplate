# Microservice Typescript Boilerplate

## Types folder

Use this folder in order to define the `.d.ts` typing files required for modules which are not typed.

For every types file that you create, follow the next structure:

1. Create a folder with the exact name of the module you are typing.
2. Create an `index.d.ts` file into this folder and define your types into it.
